These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations.

We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h.

We consider\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically.

{"id": "doc_0085", "text": "Title: A Universality in PP-Waves\nAbstract: We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in\nspace-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds.

In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed.

Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

Various\nmechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the\nDresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon\ninteraction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due\nto the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the\nelectron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine\ninteraction are included. The relative contributions from these spin\ndecoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the\nspin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked\neffect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying\nboth the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either\nin Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite\ntemperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the\nFermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high\ntemperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the\nequation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved.

By\nanalysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse\nproximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:\nQSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,\n$\\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\\vartheta=16.28$\narcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably\ncreated by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the\ncorresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of\nthe extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the\nUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three\nforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background\nmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal\nline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints\non the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars\nshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of\nthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.\nThus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in\noverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.\nFurthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative\ntransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed\nspectral shape variations.

We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate.

The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results.

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\nconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight\nimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out\nmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the\nstandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations."}

Aims: This motivates planet searches around\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection\nadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and\nreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated\nthan the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf\nwith and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn\nfrom the same parent distribution.

We are able\nto pinpoint and understand the reasons for such and other discrepancies when\nthey appear. There is a subtle but important difference in the physics\naddressed in the two models. In particular if we reformulate the parameters in\nthe canonical model to better approximate the physics addressed in the grand\ncanonical model, calculations for observables converge. Next we turn to the\nissue of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment in\nboth canonical and grand canonical ensembles.

Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and\ninclude a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and\nthe tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a\ncluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late\ntimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the\ncentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time\n-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core\nbinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase\n(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in\nthe core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of\nmass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces\nthe observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled\ninto and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in\nstars.

A longstanding\ninfrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable\nby adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order\nhigher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless\ncone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only\nexisting approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it\nunusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to\ncode (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint\nimplementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an\nanalytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any\n'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and\nhadron levels.

We use an\nelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,\nunless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than\nearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central\nregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,\nbe approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a\nslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a\ncentrifugally supported disc.

In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the\nouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in\naccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest\nitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a\nsearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic\nbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that\nthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16\n+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13\ndays, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The\nbrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall\nperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than\nhalf the binary orbital period.

The conclusions do not depend on the particular shapes\nof the potentials and can be important in different fields of physics.

Distance\nmeasurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk\nobjects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo\ndark matter residing in such objects.\n  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white\ndwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al.

We believe this\nmodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on\nthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\nstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\ncooperation.

The reason for that is\ntwofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation\nis the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for\nwhich both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an\nextremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\\nu_\\mu\n\\to \\nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile\nneutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is\nsignificantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.\nData from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the\nfour-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of\n$\\Dmq_\\Sbl \\gtrsim 0.1 \\eVq$, \\textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this\nmass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on\n$\\theta_{13}$ that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possible\nexistence of sterile neutrinos."}

We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of\nthese three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has\ncomputed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is\nlinear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in\nthe spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction\nfield), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the\nquadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric\norbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry\naxis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a\nsingle mass multipole or current multipole.

(The\nconclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing\nhorizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped\nproduct spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas\nwarped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to\nthe types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the\nsimplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,\npossibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that\nthe spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''\ntype D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are\ngeodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes).

Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored\nsince December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within\nthis period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a\nperiod of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of\nthis variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3\ndays.

We base our\nwork mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided\nhigh-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably\nmodeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the\ndetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is often\nempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum\nfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be\npre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion\nrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier\nsuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the\ndisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering.

Given the\nmyriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing\nproblem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the\nsource to the destination. We find that for a given route, the\ndecode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative\ncoding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by\nthe usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative\ncoding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms\nof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm\nruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that\nruns in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when\nthe nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies\nusing practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of\nthe strategies on different routes."}

The observations resolved the\nhot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial\nresolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located\nwithin 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar\ndensities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows\nus to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature\nstructure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core\ntemperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial\ndifferentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced\nat the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature\nsensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The\nSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this\nhot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot\ncore and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for\nthat are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main\nsubmm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the\nlarge-scale outflow.

Archival INTEGRAL data\nand RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of\n~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic\noutbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of\nOpportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source\nbehaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The\nsource field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th\nFebruary, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,\nduring a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure\nof ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a\nSFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed\npower law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak\nluminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of\nthe optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an\noutburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,\nand they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost\nquiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously\nthought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the\nbrightest flares.

The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed\n[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density\nlimit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and\nignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have\nlower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line\nflux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that\ndifferential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in\nthe obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit\nand we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the\ntorus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of\nextinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line\nratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities\nassociated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We\nalso find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended\nand originates primarily in star forming regions.

To\nthis end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the\nnonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mu\n}\\boldsymbol{A}^{\\mu})=\\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is\nconsidered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\ninvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and\n$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn\nout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.\nHowever, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge\ninvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.\nFor the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could\nbecome directly observable at low energies."}

Motivated by this\ntension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust\nformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first\ntime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to\ntheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.\nWe find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun\nstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between\n2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on\ntime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion.

Performing a numerical solution we confirm the earlier result\nof [hep-ph/0408216] that the high energy evolution with the running coupling\nleads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The\nrunning coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape\nof the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a\nconsiderable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the\nevolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is\ndue to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the\nsubtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.\nThese subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate\nnumerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that\nwhen the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in\nthe two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other!

Gas and dust\nproperties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent\ndisk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved\nboth in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar\nmaterial is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk\ninclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position\nangle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7\nmm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.\nThe dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200\nAU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and\nCO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,\nwe obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.\nWe argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is\nstrongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of\ndust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of\nlarge bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the\ndust distribution by a low mass companion."}

We find that\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can\nproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude\nthat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift."}

We model the background interstellar radiation\nfield using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray\nbackground. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and\nthe hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating\nbecause of thermal conduction.

Data\nfrom in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the\nheliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to\nconstrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column\ndensities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the\nobservational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)\nand T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron\ndensity in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-\n0.01 cm^-3.

The low radio flux\nemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state\ninterpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is\nsimilar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at\nwhich the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between\n`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does\nhave a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN\nand GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an\nimproved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on\nconsiderably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of\ncontinuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well\nfitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.\nAlthough a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by\nadding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not\nunusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second\nbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate\nimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found\nin NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other\nAGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate."}

Entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters.

We show that, for lines\nthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line\ncritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming\nmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar\nphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation\nbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines\nprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star\nformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a\nsimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous\ncan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic\nluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and\nnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict\nthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which\nthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may\nbe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate\ncritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high\nredshift galaxies with very high densities.

For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a\nquantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,\nthe corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products\nof system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of\nthe quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit\ntrace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent\nrelations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under\ncontraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.\nAs examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we\nconsider a quantum system evolving by It\\^o stochastic and by jump process\nSchr\\\"odinger equations.

We solve numerically\nthe coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the\nspin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode\namplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,\nthe mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is\nreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.\nEventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a\ncyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a\nfull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational\nradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long\ntimescale of about $10^6$ years.

While it is now clear that\nthis UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars\nwithout large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin\nhas remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their\nenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf\npopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population\nsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the\nbinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot\nsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces\nmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of\nobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution\nwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\ngeneral.

One\nof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced\nvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic\nvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth.

BSNRs with converging\nsimilar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs."}

Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\nunsynchronizable state."}

We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor\nmass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} <\n0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\nmass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al\n(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that\ngoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type\ngalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and\ndoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that\nmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,\nand (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three\ntrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive\nearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,\nour model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies\nform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than\n95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1}\n\\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass\nearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major\nmerger.

Two complementary approaches are therefore\nintroduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same\nordered pattern.

The best\nfitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixed\nfaint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The\nrate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent\nwith that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal\nmechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the\ngeneral decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different\nenvironments.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques.

The July 2005\nobservation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,\nmonitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is\ncomparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst.

In estimating the probability, we\nconsider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as\nthe ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the\nphotometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from\nprevious studies that the probability increases with the increase of the\nmagnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which\nperturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost\noccurs at moderate magnifications of $A\\lesssim 20$, implying that probability\ncan be high even for events with moderate magnifications.

However, the weak\nionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able\nto effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation\nequilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk\nmidplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling\nby soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the\nconductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have\ngrown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields\ncan begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are\ngenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while\nelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the\nmagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.\n  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have\na combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated\nto 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2.

In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\n$\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\sim\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\neV.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in multiple access\ncommunication systems that spread their transmitted energy over very large\nbandwidths. These systems, which are referred to as ultra wide-band (UWB)\nsystems, have various advantages over narrow-band and conventional wide-band\nsystems. The importance of multiuser detection for achieving high data or low\nbit error rates in these systems has already been established in several\nstudies. This paper presents iterative ('turbo') multiuser detection for\nimpulse radio (IR) UWB systems over multipath channels. While this approach is\ndemonstrated for UWB signals, it can also be used in other systems that use\nsimilar types of signaling. When applied to the type of signals used by UWB\nsystems, the complexity of the proposed detector can be quite low. Also, two\nvery low complexity implementations of the iterative multiuser detection scheme\nare proposed based on Gaussian approximation and soft interference\ncancellation. The performance of these detectors is assessed using simulations\nthat demonstrate their favorable properties."}

Nuclear pore complexes are constantly confronted by large fluxes of\nmacromolecules and macromolecular complexes that need to get into and out of\nthe nucleus. Such bi-directional traffic occurring in a narrow channel can\neasily lead to jamming. How then is passage between the nucleus and cytoplasm\nmaintained under the varying conditions that arise during the lifetime of the\ncell? Here, we address this question using computer simulations in which the\nbehaviour of the ensemble of transporting cargoes is analyzed under different\nconditions. We suggest that traffic can exist in two distinct modes, depending\non concentration of cargoes and dissociation rates of the transport\nreceptor-cargo complexes from the pores. In one mode, which prevails when\ndissociation is quick and cargo concentration is low, transport in either\ndirection proceeds uninterrupted by the other direction. The result is that\noverall-traffic-direction fluctuates rapidly and unsystematically between\nimport and export. Remarkably, when cargo concentrations are high and\ndissociation is slow, another mode takes over in which traffic proceeds in one\ndirection for a certain extent of time, after which it flips direction for\nanother period. The switch between this, more regulated, mode of transport and\nthe other, quickly fluctuating state, does not require an active gating\nmechanism but rather occurs spontaneously through the dynamics of the\ntransported particles themselves. The determining factor for the behaviour of\ntraffic is found to be the exit rate from the pore channel, which is directly\nrelated to the activity of the Ran system that controls the loading and release\nof cargo in the appropriate cellular compartment."}

In 1953, Kuhn showed that every sequential game has a Nash equilibrium by\nshowing that a procedure, named ``backward induction'' in game theory, yields a\nNash equilibrium. It actually yields Nash equilibria that define a proper\nsubclass of Nash equilibria. In 1965, Selten named this proper subclass subgame\nperfect equilibria. In game theory, payoffs are rewards usually granted at the\nend of a game. Although traditional game theory mainly focuses on real-valued\npayoffs that are implicitly ordered by the usual total order over the reals,\nworks of Simon or Blackwell already involved partially ordered payoffs. This\npaper generalises the notion of sequential game by replacing real-valued payoff\nfunctions with abstract atomic objects, called outcomes, and by replacing the\nusual total order over the reals with arbitrary binary relations over outcomes,\ncalled preferences. This introduces a general abstract formalism where Nash\nequilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium, and ``backward induction'' can still\nbe defined. This paper proves that the following three propositions are\nequivalent: 1) Preferences over the outcomes are acyclic. 2) Every sequential\ngame has a Nash equilibrium. 3) Every sequential game has a subgame perfect\nequilibrium.

First, this paper\npresents two generalizations of the notions of hitting and cover times to\nweighted graphs. Indeed, the properties of random walks on symmetrically\nweighted graphs provide interesting results on random walk based distributed\nalgorithms, such as local load balancing. Both of these generalization are\nproposed to precisely represent the behaviour of these algorithms, and to take\ninto account what the weights represent.

The present results are discussed in the light of Wind Imaging\nInterferometer (WINDII) observations of greenline dayglow emission in the\naltitude range of 92 - 105 Km. It is found that the Solar2000 V2.25 flux model\ngives better agreement with the WINDII observations especially in the 92 - 96\nKm where the earlier models predicted a very low emission rate. In the\nmesospheric emission peak region the present results are higher than the\nmeasurements and this discrepancy may possibly be attributed due to higher\nvalues of solar fluxes for those spectral lines which are main sources of the\nproduction of greenline dayglow emission. The present study suggests the\nreexamination of Solar2000 flux model at least for those spectral lines which\nare the main sources of greenline dayglow emission in mesospheric emission peak\nregion."}

With a Stark decelerator, beams of neutral polar molecules can be\naccelerated, guided at a constant velocity, or decelerated.

These couplings are nearly absent when the decelerator\noperates such that only every third electric field stage is used for\ndeceleration, while extra transverse focusing is provided by the intermediate\nstages.

Phase transition in fullerenes C60 and C240 are investigated by means of\nconstant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. In the phase transition\nregion, the assembly (and fragmentation) of the C60 cage from (and to) the\ngaseous state is demonstrated via the dynamical coexistence of two phases. In\nthis critical region, the fullerene system is seen to continuously oscillate\nbetween the carbon cage (the solid phase) and the state of carbon dimers and\nshort chains (the gas phase). These oscillations correspond to consecutive\ndisintegration and formation of the fullerene. Furthermore, the\ntemperature-dependent heat capacity of the fullerene features a prominent peak,\nsignifying the finite system analogue of a first-order phase transition.

The minimal density model for negative streamer ionization fronts is\ninvestigated. An earlier moving boundary approximation for this model consisted\nof a \"kinetic undercooling\" type boundary condition in a Laplacian growth\nproblem of Hele-Shaw type. Here we derive a curvature correction to the moving\nboundary approximation that resembles surface tension. The calculation is based\non solvability analysis with unconventional features, namely, there are three\nrelevant zero modes of the adjoint operator, one of them diverging;\nfurthermore, the inner/outer matching ahead of the front has to be performed on\na line rather than on an extended region; and the whole calculation can be\nperformed analytically. The analysis reveals a relation between the fields\nahead and behind a slowly evolving curved front, the curvature and the\ngenerated conductivity. This relation forces us to give up the ideal\nconductivity approximation, and we suggest to replace it by a constant\nconductivity approximation. This implies that the electric potential in the\nstreamer interior is no longer constant but solves a Laplace equation; this\nleads to a Muskat-type problem."}

Recently, the iterative approach named linear tabling has received\nconsiderable attention because of its simplicity, ease of implementation, and\ngood space efficiency. Linear tabling is a framework from which different\nmethods can be derived based on the strategies used in handling looping\nsubgoals. One decision concerns when answers are consumed and returned. This\npaper describes two strategies, namely, {\\it lazy} and {\\it eager} strategies,\nand compares them both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate\nthat, while the lazy strategy has good locality and is well suited for finding\nall solutions, the eager strategy is comparable in speed with the lazy strategy\nand is well suited for programs with cuts. Linear tabling relies on depth-first\niterative deepening rather than suspension to compute fixpoints. Each cluster\nof inter-dependent subgoals as represented by a top-most looping subgoal is\niteratively evaluated until no subgoal in it can produce any new answers. Naive\nre-evaluation of all looping subgoals, albeit simple, may be computationally\nunacceptable. In this paper, we also introduce semi-naive optimization, an\neffective technique employed in bottom-up evaluation of logic programs to avoid\nredundant joins of answers, into linear tabling. We give the conditions for the\ntechnique to be safe (i.e. sound and complete) and propose an optimization\ntechnique called {\\it early answer promotion} to enhance its effectiveness.\nBenchmarking in B-Prolog demonstrates that with this optimization linear\ntabling compares favorably well in speed with the state-of-the-art\nimplementation of SLG."}

It is\nshown that a high value of the relative permittivity of the substrate is\nessential for the operation of the absorber. The main contribution of the paper\nis to demonstrate and practically use the presence of an additional resonance\nof high-impedance surfaces when the plasma frequency of the wire medium\ncomprising metallic vias in the dielectric substrate is close to the original\nresonance of the high-impedance surface. The presence of the vias between FSS\nand the ground plane is discussed both for the case of a high-permittivity\nabsorber and for a low permittivity one. The radius of the vias influences the\noblique incidence TM absorption, and when properly designed, the insertion of\nthe vias result in bandwidth enlargement and higher absorption."}

Coding in the projective space has received recently a lot of attention due\nto its application in network coding. Reduced row echelon form of the linear\nsubspaces and Ferrers diagram can play a key role for solving coding problems\nin the projective space. In this paper we propose a method to design\nerror-correcting codes in the projective space. We use a multilevel approach to\ndesign our codes. First, we select a constant weight code. Each codeword\ndefines a skeleton of a basis for a subspace in reduced row echelon form. This\nskeleton contains a Ferrers diagram on which we design a rank-metric code. Each\nsuch rank-metric code is lifted to a constant dimension code. The union of\nthese codes is our final constant dimension code. In particular the codes\nconstructed recently by Koetter and Kschischang are a subset of our codes. The\nrank-metric codes used for this construction form a new class of rank-metric\ncodes. We present a decoding algorithm to the constructed codes in the\nprojective space. The efficiency of the decoding depends on the efficiency of\nthe decoding for the constant weight codes and the rank-metric codes. Finally,\nwe use puncturing on our final constant dimension codes to obtain large codes\nin the projective space which are not constant dimension."}

This\ndistance-dependent route selection problem is approached from the viewpoint of\nenergy efficiency, where a route is selected with the objective of minimizing\nthe transmission energy consumed while satisfying a target outage criterion at\nthe final destination.

The article traces the way Einstein formulated the relation between energy\nand mass in his work from 1905 to 1955. Einstein emphasized quite often that\nthe mass $m$ of a body is equivalent to its rest energy $E_0$. At the same time\nhe frequently resorted to the less clear-cut statement of equivalence of energy\nand mass. As a result, Einstein's formula $E_0=mc^2$ still remains much less\nknown than its popular form, $E=mc^2$, in which $E$ is the total energy equal\nto the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy of a freely moving body.\nOne of the consequences of this is the widespread fallacy that the mass of a\nbody increases when its velocity increases and even that this is an\nexperimental fact. As wrote the playwright A N Ostrovsky \"Something must exist\nfor people, something so austere, so lofty, so sacrosanct that it would make\nprofaning it unthinkable.\""}

This\nmakes the trust authorities, who process and publish trust recommendations,\ninto an attractive target for attacks and spoofing.

While such findings can be attributed to a lack of diligence in trust\nauthorities, or even to conflicts of interest, our analysis of trust dynamics\nsuggests that public trust networks would probably remain vulnerable even if\ntrust authorities were perfectly diligent. The reason is that the process of\ntrust building, if trust is not breached too often, naturally leads to\npower-law distributions: the rich get richer, the trusted attract more trust.\nThe evolutionary processes with such distributions, ubiquitous in nature, are\nknown to be robust with respect to random failures, but vulnerable to adaptive\nattacks.

Wireless sensor networks place sensors into an area to collect data and send\nthem back to a base station. Data fusion, which fuses the collected data before\nthey are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the network.\nSince the sensor is typically placed in locations accessible to malicious\nattackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important.\nA witness-based approach has been proposed to validate the fusion data. In this\napproach, the base station receives the fusion data and \"votes\" on the data\nfrom a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes,\ncalled \"witnesses,\" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the\nbase station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could\nforge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the\nvote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires\nmore bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base\nstation. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the\nwitness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed\nscheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The\nwitness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a\nproblem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the\nvote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and\nsimulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times\nbetter overhead than the witness-based approach."}

We are interested in nonlinear hyperbolic systems in nonconservative form\narising in fluid dynamics, and, for solutions containing shock waves, we\ninvestigate the convergence of finite difference schemes applied to such\nsystems. According to Dal Maso, LeFloch, and Murat's theory, a shock wave\ntheory for a given nonconservative system requires prescribing a priori a\nfamily of paths in the phase space. In the present paper, we consider schemes\nthat are formally consistent with a given family of paths, and we investigate\ntheir limiting behavior as the mesh is refined. We generalize to systems a\nproperty established earlier by Hou and LeFloch for scalar conservation laws,\nand we prove that nonconservative schemes generate, at the level of the\nlimiting hyperbolic system, a \"convergence error\" source-term which, provided\nthe total variation of the approximations remains uniformly bounded, is a\nlocally bounded measure. We discuss the role of the equivalent equation\nassociated with a difference scheme; here, the distinction between scalar\nequations and systems appears most clearly since, for systems, the equivalent\nequation of a scheme that is formally path-consistent depends upon the\nprescribed family of paths. The core of this paper is devoted to investigate\nnumerically the approximation of several models arising in fluid dynamics. For\nsystems having nonconservative products associated with linearly degenerate\ncharacteristic fields, the convergence error vanishes. For some other models,\nthis measure is evaluated very accurately, especially by plotting the shock\ncurves associated with each scheme under consideration."}

We propose to study concurrent imitation dynamics that\nemerge when each player samples another player and possibly imitates this\nagents' strategy if the anticipated latency gain is sufficiently large. Our\nmain focus is on convergence properties. Using a potential function argument,\nwe show that our dynamics converge in a monotonic fashion to stable states. In\nsuch a state none of the players can improve its latency by imitating somebody\nelse. As our main result, we show rapid convergence to approximate equilibria.\nAt an approximate equilibrium only a small fraction of agents sustains a\nlatency significantly above or below average. In particular, imitation dynamics\nbehave like fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS). Fixing all\nother parameters, the convergence time depends only in a logarithmic fashion on\nthe number of agents. Since imitation processes are not innovative they cannot\ndiscover unused strategies. Furthermore, strategies may become extinct with\nnon-zero probability. For the case of singleton games, we show that the\nprobability of this event occurring is negligible.

The sensitivity\nanalysis is then used for developing a fixed-point implementation of a sample\nfilter from the class of GCF filters, used as reference filter throughout the\npaper. Finally, we present computer simulations in order to evaluate the\nperformance of the designed fixed-point filters."}

The predicted\ndistribution is close to the Gaussian distribution for small-scale fluctuations\nbut exhibits fat long tail for large-scale fluctuations with higher probability\nof occurrence than predicted by Gaussian distribution. Since the power\n(variance i.e. square of eddy amplitude) spectrum also represents the\nprobability densities as in the case of quantum systems such as the electron or\nphoton, fractal fluctuations exhibit quantumlike chaos.

Valiant introduced some 25 years ago an algebraic model of computation along\nwith the complexity classes VP and VNP, which can be viewed as analogues of the\nclassical classes P and NP. They are defined using non-uniform sequences of\narithmetic circuits and provides a framework to study the complexity for\nsequences of polynomials. Prominent examples of difficult (that is,\nVNP-complete) problems in this model includes the permanent and hamiltonian\npolynomials. While the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials in general are\ndifficult to evaluate, there have been research on which special cases of these\npolynomials admits efficient evaluation. For instance, Barvinok has shown that\nif the underlying matrix has bounded rank, both the permanent and the\nhamiltonian polynomials can be evaluated in polynomial time, and thus are in\nVP. Courcelle, Makowsky and Rotics have shown that for matrices of bounded\ntreewidth several difficult problems (including evaluating the permanent and\nhamiltonian polynomials) can be solved efficiently. An earlier result of this\nflavour is Kasteleyn's theorem which states that the sum of weights of perfect\nmatchings of a planar graph can be computed in polynomial time, and thus is in\nVP also. For general graphs this problem is VNP-complete. In this paper we\ninvestigate the expressive power of the above results.

The Casimir force, which results from the confinement of the quantum\nmechanical zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields, has received\nsignificant attention in recent years for its effect on micro- and nano-scale\nmechanical systems. With few exceptions, experimental observations have been\nlimited to conductive bodies interacting separated by vacuum or air. However,\ninteresting phenomena including repulsive forces are expected to exist in\ncertain circumstances between metals and dielectrics when the intervening\nmedium is not vacuum. In order to better understand the effect of the Casimir\nforce in such situations and to test the robustness of the generalized\nCasimir-Lifshitz theory, we have performed the first precision measurements of\nthe Casimir force between two metals immersed in a fluid. For this situation,\nthe measured force is attractive and is approximately 80% smaller than the\nforce predicted by Casimir for ideal metals in vacuum.

We showcase the scalability, performance and reliability of the\nintegrated system using application examples drawn from astronomy, cognitive\nneuroscience and molecular dynamics, which all comprise large number of\nfine-grained jobs. We show that Swift is able to represent dynamic workflows\nwhose structures can only be determined during runtime and reduce largely the\ncode size of various workflow representations using SwiftScript; schedule the\nexecution of hundreds of thousands of parallel computations via the Karajan\nengine; and achieve up to 90% reduction in execution time when compared to\ntraditional batch schedulers."}

We introduce a minimal Agent Based Model for financial markets to understand\nthe nature and Self-Organization of the Stylized Facts. The model is minimal in\nthe sense that we try to identify the essential ingredients to reproduce the\nmain most important deviations of price time series from a Random Walk\nbehavior. We focus on four essential ingredients: fundamentalist agents which\ntend to stabilize the market; chartist agents which induce destabilization;\nanalysis of price behavior for the two strategies; herding behavior which\ngoverns the possibility of changing strategy. Bubbles and crashes correspond to\nsituations dominated by chartists, while fundamentalists provide a long time\nstability (on average). The Stylized Facts are shown to correspond to an\nintermittent behavior which occurs only for a finite value of the number of\nagents N. Therefore they correspond to finite size effect which, however, can\noccur at different time scales. We propose a new mechanism for the\nSelf-Organization of this state which is linked to the existence of a threshold\nfor the agents to be active or not active. The feedback between price\nfluctuations and number of active agents represent a crucial element for this\nstate of Self-Organized-Intermittency. The model can be easily generalized to\nconsider more realistic variants."}

Besides confirming earlier findings, that wave power\ninitially peaks on the mixed mode branch, it is observed that, during late time\nevolution wave power is transferred to other wave numbers. It is argued that\nthe isotropization of power in wavenumber space may be a consequence of weak\nturbulence. Further, some modifications to the ideal weak turbulence limit is\nobserved. Development of almost isotropic predominantly electrostatic --\npartially electromagnetic -- turbulent spectra holds relevance when considering\nthe spectral emission signatures of the plasma, namely bremsstrahlung,\nrespectively magneto-bremsstrahlung (synchrotron radiation and jitter\nradiation) from relativistic shocks in astrophysical jets and shocks from\ngamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei."}

Such flows\nmediate couplings between neighbouring wave numbers within $k_d$ of each other\nonly.

We then introduce random\nchannels (fading/shadowing) and give TC and outage approximations for an\narbitrary channel distribution, as well as exact results for the special cases\nof Rayleigh and Nakagami fading. We then apply these results to show how TC can\nbe used to better understand scheduling, power control, and the deployment of\nmultiple antennas in a decentralized network. The paper closes by discussing\nshortcomings in the model as well as future research directions."}
